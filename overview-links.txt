Pontos principais:

It is simple. You don’t need to go through a plethora of pop-ups telling you what or how to do certain things. Once you hit ‘Start’, just tap once, and you’re good to go. It’s like this classic Mobile Suit Gundam trope where a pilot who falls into the cockpit exactly knows what he’s doing.

It relies on nostalgia—in a good way. Compared to other titles that use retro elements just to rupture the gamers’ wallets, Flappy Bird does not. While we can all wholeheartedly agree that the environment is strikingly similar to the world of that fat Italian plumber who binges on shrooms and flowers and tries to save the princess from a TMNT reject, it does not use those elements to present itself as part of a legendary franchise from where it borrowed those elements. Besides, our love-hate relationship with this game reminds us of our exes.

It has no microtransactions. In a gaming landscape where you can pay to get away from the hardships of gaming, Flappy Bird is one of the few games that went against the grain and took out its sadistic urges on you. There are no shortcuts; every point must be earned with blood, sweat, and tons of cussing. If you can get a three-digit score, you deserve it. If not, you cannot bribe your way to those tunnels.
It is fun. It is hypocritical to say that Flappy Bird is not a fun game. Other than giving you hypertension and sore thumbs, the reason why you get hooked to it is because of the fun factor you keep on denying. Come on, admit it. I can see a smile!

In the end, Flappy Bird may not be a game that deserves a throne in the pantheon of legendary video games. The idea and design may not be, to say the least, unique, but this piece of game is a reminder to all of us what gaming should be all about: having fun.
